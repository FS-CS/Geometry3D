About Geometry3D
================

Geometry3D is a simple python computational geographics library written in python.
This library focus on the function and lacks efficiency which might be improved in future version.


Core Features
-------------
- Basic 3D Geometries: Point, Line, Plane, Segment, Convex Polygen and Convex Polyhedron
- Basic Attributes of Geometries: length, area, volume
- Basic Relationships and Operations Between Geometries: move, angle, parallel, orthogonal, intersection
- A Naive Renderer using matplotlib.
